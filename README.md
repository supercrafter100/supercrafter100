### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Supercrafter100, a student / developer that loves working on random stuff. I am learning about everything that I would like to learn. Currently trying to learn html / css to develop websites.

I love working together with Jeroeno_boy, hes an amazing person and very good at coding.

I live in belgium in a small town. 

Fun fact: I have a really bad pc that has about 1GB of free storage space so I wont be doing big projects ðŸ¤”
